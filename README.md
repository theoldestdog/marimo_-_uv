Trying out Marimo and uv with Python

I'm new to programming and trying different processes out. I've used Jupyter Notebooks and watched a review of both Marimo and uv.
Nothing that I do requires particular rigour but since Marimo is written I Rust I believe it is more fussy about how variables are named and used than Jupyter is. As a newbie, it can only help to adopt this rigour early on rather than try to graft it on later.
So far, so good. Marimo looks and acts like a Jupyter Notebook so the transition isn't hard and uv does some of the heavy lifting creating venv's,loading packages. Marimo saves itself as a .py and can convert ipynb files into Marimo.

I'll play it out longer and see how I like it long-term.
